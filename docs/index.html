      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>

        <p>
          The Bauhaus, founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius in Weimar, unified art, craft, and industrial production within a single pedagogical framework. Its foundation course, the Vorkurs, introduced students to materials, color theory, and geometric abstraction before specialization. Guided by functionalism and the principle “form follows function,” Bauhaus rejected ornament in favor of modular composition and structural clarity. Faculty such as László Moholy-Nagy advanced experimentation in typography and photography. When the school closed in 1933, its faculty dispersed internationally, spreading modernist design principles worldwide.

      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style, emerged in the 1950s and emphasized objective communication through grid systems and sans-serif typography. Designers such as Josef Müller-Brockmann structured compositions using asymmetrical layout and precise typographic hierarchy to achieve visual order. Photography replaced illustration to reinforce clarity and neutrality. The baseline grid ensured alignment and consistency across layouts. Swiss Style sought universal readability by minimizing authorial expression in favor of rational structure.

      <h2>New Wave Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1970s–1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          New Wave Typography developed in the 1970s as a reaction against the strict grid discipline of Swiss Style. Led by Wolfgang Weingart, designers disrupted the baseline grid through typographic layering, variable spacing, and expressive typography. Rather than abandoning structure entirely, New Wave manipulated grid systems to introduce movement and spatial tension. The movement maintained modernist foundations while expanding typographic experimentation beyond objective neutrality.
