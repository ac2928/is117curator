# AGENTS.md — Master Implementation Letter

# The Mandate
The goal of this website is to present Aarav Chopra as an NJIT student seeking frontend internship or entry-level tech roles. The site should clearly communicate skills, projects, and availability to recruiters and hiring managers within five seconds of landing on the page.

# The Tech Stack
- HTML (beginner)
- CSS (beginner)
- JavaScript (beginner)

This stack was chosen to keep the site lightweight, easy to deploy, and aligned with the student’s current skill level. Heavier frameworks were intentionally avoided to prioritize speed and clarity.

# The Target Audience
Recruiters and hiring managers reviewing candidates for internships or entry-level frontend or web development roles.
