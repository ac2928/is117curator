WHAT I ALREADY KNOW
Bauhaus was a German design school founded in the early 20th century. It focused on combining art, craft, and technology. Swiss Style emphasized grid systems, clean typography, and objective communication. New Wave Typography reacted against Swiss order and loosened the grid system. Wolfgang Weingart played a major role in New Wave.

WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
The exact founding and closing dates of Bauhaus.
The specific curriculum structure of the Vorkurs.
The precise difference between Bauhaus functionalism and Swiss objectivity.
The technical typographic techniques used in New Wave.
Which museum collections document primary examples.
