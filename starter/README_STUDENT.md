## Project Overview
This project is a professional portfolio website created to present my skills and projects as an NJIT student seeking frontend internship or entry-level tech roles.

## Orchestration Log
During development, the AI initially generated an unnecessary `src` and `dist` project structure. I recognized that this did not align with the course requirement to use GitHub Pages with a `/docs` directory, so I removed the extra folders and kept `/docs` as the single source of truth for the website.
