Prompt 1

Phase: Exploration

Prompt name: Concept Map

What I sent:

Create a concept map connecting Bauhaus (1919–1933), Swiss Style (1950s–1970s), and New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s). Show key figures, core principles, and how each movement influenced or reacted to the previous one.

What I got back (summary):

The output clearly showed Bauhaus influencing Swiss Style through functionalism and grid-based structure. It explained that New Wave reacted against the strict grid discipline of Swiss design.

What I did with it:

I pinned the useful structural relationships into CURATOR_NOTES.md and discarded vague language.


Prompt 2

Phase: Production

Prompt name: Draft Labels

What I sent:

Draft museum-label style Curator Cards (80–120 words each) for Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography using domain vocabulary only.

What I got back (summary):

The AI generated structured paragraphs using relevant vocabulary but required editing for clarity and precision.

What I did with it:

I refined the descriptions manually and verified historical claims before inserting them into index.html.


Prompt 3

Phase: Critique

Prompt name: Expert Critique — Wolfgang Weingart

What I sent:

Review my New Wave Typography Curator Card as if you were Wolfgang Weingart. Critique the accuracy and vocabulary. Flag anything uncertain as VERIFY.

What I got back (summary):

The critique emphasized that New Wave manipulated grid systems rather than abandoning structure entirely.

What I did with it:

I revised the New Wave paragraph to emphasize grid disruption rather than total rejection of structure.
