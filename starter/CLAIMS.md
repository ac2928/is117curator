Reflection

One AI claim I didn’t trust at first and how I verified it:

The AI initially described New Wave Typography as completely rejecting structure. That seemed too absolute. After reviewing museum documentation and design history sources, I confirmed that New Wave disrupted and manipulated grid systems rather than abandoning structure entirely.
